# Summative Assignment

## Project Overview
This project is a summative assignment that focuses on exploring linear regression implementation using multiple approaches:

Linear regression using NumPy's polyfit
Machine learning models from scikit-learn
Gradient descent implementation from scratch. The notebook contains data analysis, modeling, and visualizations that address the given problem statement.

## Contents
- **Data Preparation:** Steps involved in cleaning and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand data patterns.
- **Model Development:** Implementation of machine learning models (if applicable).
- **Results & Evaluation:** Performance metrics and analysis of the findings.
- **Conclusion:** Summary of insights and potential improvements.
